/**

    May be called by a service to notify the service manager about state changes.
    It can be used to send arbitrary information, encoded in an
    environment-block-like string. Most importantly, can be used for start-up
    completion notification.

    Params:
    unset_environment =-if non-zero, this method will unset the $NOTIFY_SOCKET
                        env. variable before returning (regardless of whether
                        the function call itself succeeded or not. Further calls to
                        this method will then fail, but the variable is no longer
                        inherited by child process.
    state = should contain a newline-separated list of variable assignments,
            similar in style to environment block. See `man 3 sd_notify` for
            more details.

    Returns:
        on failure, returns a negative errno-style error code. If $NOTIFY_SOCKET
        was not set and hence no status data could be sent, 0 is returned.
        If succeeded, function will return a positive return value. In order to
        support both, init systems that implement this scheme and those which
        do not, it is generally recommended to ignore the return value of this
        call.
