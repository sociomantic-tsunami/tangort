## Configure coverage via environment variables

Now some coverage options can be set via environment variables:

* `DRT_COVMERGE`: Merge current results with pre-existing coverage reports.
* `DRT_COVSRCPATH`: Set path to where source files are located.
* `DRT_COVDSTPATH`: Set path to where listing files are to be written.
